# CheapestRideFinderInMumbai
This page describes an app that users can use to find out the cheapest form of transportation to go between places in Mumbai, India.

Description:

Ever wondered what'd be the cheapest way to go between two places in Mumbai, India (for now, will expand to more cities soon). If you are like me and don't have a car in India but still want good value for your money to move around, look no further. This app will help you get the cheapest form of transportation (no bus fares yet) to go between places in Mumbai by comparing:

1. Auto rickshaw
2. Taxi (Kali Peeli)
3. Uber (all variants)
4. Ola (all variants)
5. Genie Cab
6. Tab Cab
7. Meru Cabs
8. Easy Cab
9. Taxi for Sure

Pre-requisites:

1. You will need to get an API key for LUIS (and train your language model to understand the utterances)
2. Google Geocoding API (https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/start) to convert places to latitude and longitude coordinates.
3. Google Distance Matrix API (https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/distance-matrix/) to get the distance and duration between places.
4. Visual Studio 2015
5. Curiosity (most important)

Feel free to drop in questions or issues and I'll take a look at the first possible opportunity.
